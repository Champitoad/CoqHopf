# CoqHopf
Construction of the Hopf fibration in Homotopy Type Theory, using the HoTT library for Coq.

## Installation
You will need to install the [HoTT library for Coq](https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT).

## Usage
I recommend using the `hoqide` script to run the familiar CoqIDE with all required dependencies preloaded.
