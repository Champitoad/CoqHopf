# CoqHopf
Construction of the Hopf fibration in Homotopy Type Theory, using the HoTT library for Coq.

## Installation
You will need to install the [HoTT library for Coq](https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT).

## Usage
I recommend using the `hoqide` script to run the familiar CoqIDE with all required dependencies preloaded.  
Then you can load the script `Homework.v` as usual.

You can also access the [HTML version of the script](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Champitoad/CoqHopf/blob/master/Homework.html) rendered with `coqdoc`.
